Sending and receiving audio.

1. basics
    - Getting audio input from the microphone.
        > microphone.devices -> dropdown to select which one to use.
        > Microphone.Start to start listening. Can only be for a certain amount of time. 
            -> "start - loop = true" will force it to skip to the beginning to continue writing.
            -> use this start as offset and the data length to send the audio.
        > Get microphone frequency info to actually setup that stuff.

2. using the audio data.
    - audioClip.GetData
    - the float[] needs to be converted to a byte[] 
    - compress it? 
    - send it to the server
    - server sends it to all players that are supposed to hear it.
    - client receives audio
    - convert byte[] back to float[]
    - audioClip.SetData -> audioSource.Play if not playing already.
